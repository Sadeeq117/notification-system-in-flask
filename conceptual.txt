Since Front end is using RxJS to handel the real time updates backend need to provide continuous stream of events.
As you have mention we do have different approches to perfrom this they are :
  1. Server Sent Events(SSE) --> Unidirectional.
  2. WebScokets --> Bidirectional.

As of now its a light solution we can preffer SSE.

How Actually a SSE works?
    SSE is a light weight and efficient way to stream task updates.
    1. Client subscribe to task updates by opening a connection using rxjs-sse fromEventSource().
    2. Server pushes the updates when ever a change happend and we do have list of subscribe in server to trigger the change.
    3. RxJS handle the stream to update UI.
